# Assets

This directory contains the static assets used by the game, such as images, textures, and data files.

## Contents

- **Atlases**: Texture atlases (PNG) and their corresponding JSON metadata (e.g., `planet-atlas-medium.png`, `star-atlas-medium.json`). These combine multiple smaller images into a single file for efficient rendering.
- **`planets/`**: Raw planet images.
- **`stars/`**: Raw star images.
- **`space_backgrounds*/`**: Background images for the space environment.
- **`*-processed/`**: Directories containing processed versions of the raw assets, ready for atlas generation or direct use.
