# Context: ecumenopolis city planet for a retro space strategy game
# Style: Bold, cartoony, and highly artistic with exaggerated features that make it instantly recognizable. Use vibrant colors, clear visual details, and game-friendly art (like Stellaris or FTL). Make features OBVIOUS and READABLE at a glance. NOT photorealistic - use artistic stylization with bold outlines and saturated colors. Use orthographic view. IMPORTANT: Suggest "city planet" through ABSTRACTION - use lighting patterns, color washes, and large-scale geometric features rather than depicting individual buildings (which makes it too busy). Think grid patterns of lights, glowing regions, broad color zones, and simple geometric shapes to evoke urbanization. Avoid hundreds of tiny detailed structures.
