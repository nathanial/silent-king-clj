# Context: military spaceship for a retro space strategy game, viewed from top-down perspective
# Style: Bold, cartoony, and highly artistic with exaggerated features that make it instantly recognizable. Use vibrant colors, clear visual details, and game-friendly art (like Stellaris or FTL). Make features OBVIOUS and READABLE at a glance - show distinctive details clearly. NOT photorealistic - use artistic stylization with bold outlines and saturated colors. Use orthographic top-down perspective. ALWAYS show from top-down view with engines ONLY at the back (rear) of the ship creating clear front-to-back orientation. Engines should glow brightly at the rear.
