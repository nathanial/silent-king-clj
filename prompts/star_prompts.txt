# Context: celestial star for a retro space strategy game
# Style: Bold, cartoony, and highly artistic with exaggerated features that make it instantly recognizable. Use vibrant colors, clear visual details, and game-friendly art (like Stellaris or FTL). Make features OBVIOUS and READABLE at a glance - show distinctive details clearly. NOT photorealistic - use artistic stylization with bold outlines and saturated colors. Use orthographic view.
